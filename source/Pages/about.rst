.. _best-suited-cases:

=================
Best suited cases
=================

The best-suited cases for :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` are scientific projects with a requirement to process
relatively large data sets. For example research projects suitable for :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` that deal with massive datasets are commonly in:
Genomics, Proteomics, Earth observation, Astronomical observation, Climate modeling,
Engineering or Physics experiments.

You would be eligible for :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` if your project reflects some of the following needs:

* Processing of large amount of data of many terabytes to petabytes in short time spans
* Processing of large amount of independent simulations and workflows
* Interactive processing with user-friendly interfaces for efficient data handling
* Industry standard interfaces and other interoperability features
* Co-working with your collaborators on the same project-based workspace
* Accessing external storage facilities with fast connectivity

Also :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` is a viable alternative for current and potential
`Grid`_ users who are looking to use a more customizable system. It is a low-threshold platform,
as opposed to highly complex Grid platforms that take many months of specialist development
before they can start. Being built upon the exact same physical data-processing
infrastructure and sharing the same scalable network connectivity as the
Grid-based processing environments, :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` offers the same data-parallel processing
capabilities as the most powerful Grid platforms.

Note though that while it's great for data-intensive applications,
:abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` is *not* really aimed at:

* HPC applications where operations per second are critical
* Processing of simulations that require multi-node execution
* Applications that cannot be ported onto Linux-based system


.. _collaboration:

=============
Collaboration
=============

:abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` is designed for Big Science which requires
collaboration. :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` supports several ways to collaborate, either
within your project, across projects, or to external sources.

.. _project-space:

Project space
=============

Project spaces on :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` are shared workspaces given to team members that enable collaboration through sharing data, software and workflows. Within your project space there are four folders:

* Data: for housing source data from data managers
* Share: for sharing between project members
* Public: for sharing publicly through webviews
* Software: for scripts, libraries and tools

:abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` enables collaboration for your project with granular access control to your project space through project roles, enabling collaboration for any team structure:

* *data manager* role: responsible for the management of project-owned data
* *software manager* role: responsible to install and maintain the project-owned software
* *normal user* role: scientific users who focus on data analysis

See :numref:`project-spaces-directories` for more information on the project spaces and access permissions for the different roles.

.. _scientific-catalog:

Scientific catalog
==================

Collaboration is also possible across different :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` projects. These are cases where different user groups work
on projects with different scope and goals but need to (partly) share read-only data
(such as observations or biobank data). :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` offers a place for multiple project teams to
collaborate by sharing data sets or tools. This workspace is called *scientific catalog* and it is *not* offered by default to a project but can be set up on request.

The scientific catalog data can be either *open* to everyone on the :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` platform or *private* to
selected :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` project groups.

The scientific catalog has only one (but important) role:

* *scientific catalog manager*: responsible for populating the catalog and deciding which :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data Extraction and Redistribution)` project groups have read access to that catalog.


.. _  interoperability-hotspot:

Interoperability hotspot
========================

In contrast to many of the processing platforms already available,
typically offering an all-inclusive solution within the boundaries of their
environment, :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` is exactly the opposite. It aims to be a connecting
platform in a world that has already a lot to offer in terms of storage systems,
data distribution and collaboration frameworks, software management and portability
systems, and pilot job and task management frameworks. The :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` platform can hook
them all together as an interoperability hotspot to support a variety of data
processing and data collaboration use cases.

For all supported external services, sometimes even services owned by the users themselves,
:abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` offers optimized configurations
and practical guidelines how to connect these services together
into a practical processing environment tailored specifically to each project.
