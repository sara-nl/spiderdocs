====================
Adding New Users
====================

---------------------------------------------------------
Invite New Members to the Collaborative Organization (CO)
---------------------------------------------------------

AGHub's authentication is managed using SRAM, for more information on adding new users to the AGH CO, please see SRAM documentation here:

`SRAM Documentation <https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/SRAM/Invite+admins+and+members+to+a+collaboration/>`_ 

---------------------
Add Groups for Access
---------------------

Users access is provisioned based on user groups they are assigned to. Users are automatically added to aghub_cpu and aghub_login, but need to be added to sw/data/user to control their access to the project space. For now sw/data/user groups control access to the aghub project, for now there is only one AGHub project (/project/aghub)

After adding new users, please refer then to the `AGH getting started guide` for setting up their new account and logging into the cluster.

==================================================
Managing storage - dCache / External Project Space
==================================================

---------------------
Accessing the storage
---------------------

There is no dedicated API door, so only rclone functionality is available, not ADA. There is also a dedicated webdav-agh domain or 'door' to help keep the AGH cluster access restricted. Data can only be uploaded to whitelisted IP's which can be requested through SURF's servicedesk.

"""""""""""""""
Simple download
"""""""""""""""

In order to use the AGH external storage with the use of an additional client, you can make use of the system package curl.

**Example**

.. code-block:: bash

  curl -u $USER https://webdav-agh.grid.surfsara.nl/tape/get-macaroon.sh


---------------------------------------------------
Granting access to storage - create a token for AGH
---------------------------------------------------

AGH end-point and caveat requirements here, the wedav-agh end point is dedicated for the AGH project.

After granting access to a user they can then make use

**Example**

.. code-block:: bash

  get-macaroon \
    --url https://webdav-agh.grid.surfsara.nl/tape/ \
    --user [AGH-USERNAME] \
    --permissions UPLOAD \ # should include upload only
    --duration P7D \ # whenever possible add a time limit
    --output rclone [TOKEN NAME] \
    --ip [Restricted range] \
    --chroot


=================================
 Accessing accounting information
=================================

In order to view the respective usage of projects

.. code-block:: bash
