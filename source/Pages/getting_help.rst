I cannot login after adding/changing my ssh keys
================================================

If you added or changed your SSH key on the `SURFsara portal <https://portal.surfsara.nl/>`_, access to the login node
may not be immediately possible. It can take *up to 15 minutes* to be able to login
to :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)`. In case that it takes longer time, please contact us at :ref:`helpdesk <helpdesk>`.


.. I cannot login and getting a "host key has just changed" message
.. ================================================================

.. If the host key has changed on the login node recently it will effect the 'known hosts' file that you
.. have on your PC. In order to work around this you must:

.. * remove the :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data Extraction and Redistribution)` entry from your `known hosts file` this will be different depending on your operating system of choice
.. * try to log back into the login node, you will be prompted to automatically add the new host key to your PC
