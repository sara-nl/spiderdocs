Maintenance

.. Tip:: To keep the system healthy we need sometimes to interrupt the platform for maintenance. In this page you will find:

     * our service notices logging changes or incidents on the platform
     * the current status of the platform & the maintenance log
     * our downtime policy

.. _service-notices:

===============
Service notices
===============

To make it easier for users to see what notable changes have been made in the system between maintenance and releases of :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data Extraction and Redistribution)` we keep a chronologically ordered list of notable changes and incidents. The service notices can be found in :ref:`service-notices-list`.

.. _current-status:

Current status
==============

The current status of Spider can be found in our service status page `here <https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Service+status>`__.

.. _dcache-maintenances:

dcache maintenance
==================

The dCache instance of SURF falls under the Grid components, thus dCache maintenance are not announced via the Spider notifications. If you want to receive notifications and be prepared for upcoming downtimes and maintenances of dCache, you can create personal subscriptions in the EGI operations portal by following the instructions in the Grid page `here <https://doc.grid.surfsara.nl/en/latest/Pages/Service/downtimes_maintenances.html>`__.


.. _maintenance-policy:

======
Policy
======

All :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data Extraction and Redistribution)` users are notified in advance for the scheduled maintenance windows.
Exceptions to this policy are made in the following cases:

* Urgent changes are needed for the continuity of the platform
* Patches for high-risk security issues

In these cases, the changes will be applied as soon as needed, even outside maintenance windows.
